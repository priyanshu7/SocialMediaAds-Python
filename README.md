# SocialMediaAds-Python
Having a small database of 400 social media users to whom a particular advertisement was being shown in their feed, we have the data of who bought that product and who not. Now we need to classify the people who tend to buy this product, so that any new person who sees this advertisement, we should be able to predict whether or not he'll buy the product or not.
