# SocialMediaAds-Python
Having a small database of 400 social media users to whom a particular advertisement was being shown in their feed, we have the data of who bought that product and who not. Now we need to classify the people who tend to buy this product, so that any new person who sees this advertisement, we should be able to predict whether or not he'll buy the product or not.
The idea is to find a optimized result to the above set of sitation, hence I have tried classifying the data using various Machine Learning Classifiers using sci-kit learn library, namely:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors
3. Support Vector Machines
4. Kernel SVMs
5. Naive Bayes Theorem
6. Decision Tree Classification
7. Random Forest Classification

I've analysed the results by plotting them, necessary files are provided in the repository. According to me, in the given situation, Kernel SVM and Naive Bayes generate acceptable solutions. While Decision Tree classification seems to overfit.
